        <p>Hello as you can tell from the title my name is Tishawn Whyte
            I am currently enrolled as a Computer Science Major, while 
            I may not always find most courses fun or fulfilling i do 
            enjoy the challenges that they provide and i find that my ability 
            to learn new things such as Web Devlopment. Web Devlopment interests
            me because we use websites daily and do not know how they were made or 
            even operate entirely therefore provided the opportunity to learn more 
            i leaped at the chance that i got.
