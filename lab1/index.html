        <p>Hello as you can tell from the title my name is Tishawn Whyte
            I am currently enrolled as a Computer Science Major, while 
            I may not always find most courses fun or fulfilling i do 
            enjoy the challenges that they provide and i find that my ability 
            to learn new things and conquer tasks i perviously thought 
            i could not is most thrilling.
